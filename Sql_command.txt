code for importing data from csv to sqlite3 file
PS C:\Users\Kajal> sqlite3 KunT.db
SQLite version 3.38.2 2022-03-26 13:51:10
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .mode csv 
sqlite> .import "C:/Users/Kajal/Desktop/Python Modules/favorites.csv" Tan





we are reading csv file and updating it in sqlite3
For that use following command:-

sqlite3 KunT.db
.mode csv
.import C:\Users\******\favorites.csv KunT

#comment:- The mode is use to change the file type
for importing provide the whole file path and at last give the table-name
#


2) How to display the content of table:-
sqlite>.schema 
note you should be in the same path

3) How to dispaly the content of any column:-
sqlite> SELECT title FROM kunT;
#shows all the content of column title


#If you wanted to show content of whole table 
sqlite3>SELECT * FROM KunT;
# * means select all and show




4) How to delete particular data from our db
sqlite> select title from KunT where title like "%friends%"; 
sqlite>delete from KunT where title like "%friends%";


#here where is used to compare and like is same as ==

5) How to update any data using sqlite3
sqlite3> select title from KunT where title ="Thevoffice";
#This show the Thevoffice if there in database

sqlite3> UPDATE KunT SET title = "The Office" WHERE title ="Thevoffice";
#this update or edit the Thevoffice to The Office

sqlite3>select title from KunT where title ="Thevoffice";
#This show the presence of Thevoffice



6) We wanted to get shows name who's genres include Comedy
#If we use SELECT title FROM Tan WHERE genres="Comedy";
this will give show who's genres is Comdey but not give the show name if it's "Comedy, Drama"
# so for that we are using LIKE which is same as in Python
#So as long comedy is there in our genres it will give as o/p

7) Now we used favorites8.py file to create 2 tables name shows and genres:
They stores the vlaue with maintaining the sr.no 


sqlite>(SELECT show_id FROM genres WHERE genre ="Comedy")
#This gives the show_id for data in genres table whos genre is Comdey

sqlite>(SELECT * FROM genres WHERE genre ="Comedy")
#This gives whole table i.e. sr.no with the value for genre of genres table

--->>> Clubing 2 or 3 sql qureies in single
sqlite> SELECT title FROM shows WHERE (SELECT show_id FROM genres WHERE genre ="Comedy"); 
#This gives the title from table shows whose show_id is of genres is equal to genre!


sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT(title) FROM shows WHERE (SELECT show_id FROM genres WHERE genre ="Comedy"); 
#This gives single value or avoiding reptation happening in title

sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT(title) FROM shows WHERE (SELECT show_id FROM genres WHERE genre ="Comedy") ORDER BY title; 
#This gives the order form of data i.e. arrange in sequence



#Inserting data in db using sqlite
sqlite> INSERT INTO genres (show_id,genre) VALUES (158,"Seinfeld"); 
sqlite>  SELECT DISTINCT(title) FROM shows WHERE (SELECT show_id FROM genres WHERE genre ="Comedy") ORDER BY title;
